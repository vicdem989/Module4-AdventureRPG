A lot of the //TODOS are undone, simply becasuse I focused way more on the other requirements. I simply forgot to do all of them. Here I am probably losing a lot, which is something I wish I could improve on the other modules.

Finishing the requirements for this module was super fun. Adding the cheat codes, the poison tick rate and everything. Adding so that different mobs has different types of debuff. However, I do wish I learned to use interfaces properly. This would make the debuff code way cooler and simpler to use. 

After understanding the communication between .adv file and adventure.cs file. The module became much more interesting. However, that took a long while to crack.

I wanted to do so much with this module, but being held back by unfinished requirements and short time to complete was unfortunate. I get now why module 9 was supposed to be a grand module, a module I would have enjoyed and learned a lot from doing. 

Figuring out how the .adv worked 100% was something I did not manage to do. Therefore, updating location description when items are removed are something I never manged to figure out. I assume you could make an object of the location and assign some values such as description etc. Then display those descriptions as the player changes the room. 

Cheat codes was also super fun to add. While simple, adding cheat codes such as TP and increase in HP was fun to create. 



### File Structure

All your code and related files should be neatly organized in a Zip file, with the following internal structure:

```
module_4_Adventure
├── Adventure.cs
├── Game.cs
├── Location.cs
├── Item.cs
├── *.*
└── readme.md
```

This is your opportunity to demonstrate not just what you've learned, but how you can apply it creatively and effectively in a real programming project.
